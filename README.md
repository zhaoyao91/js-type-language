# JS Type Language

Help define types for JS.

## Introduction

The point is simple: to doc my js things.

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Flow](https://flow.org/) are both great tools to enhance js with 
static type checking ability. However, they are intrusive, you are no longer writing pure js, and you have to setup tons 
of tools to translate your code before writing.

[JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) seems match the initial requirement, but it is really a big monster with too many knifes
and forks to fulfill my little wish. It also failed to provide ability to define custom function type.

So, I create this repo, wish to create something clear, simple and easy while enough to express what js code failed to 
say, either in comments or documents.
